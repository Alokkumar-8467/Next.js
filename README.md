# 2. Dynamic route

In dynamic route we can pass routes so we have to make a particulat route.js page. Suppose if we want to pass user-id for 100 users, for that we have to made 100 routes and it's make our app full of routes.
So, for these kinds of problem we use DYNAMIC ROUTES.
In Dynamic route we pass route inside square bracket [].
`localhost:3000/api/users/[userid]`. "[userid]" changes many times.

We can pass more than one dynamic routes at a time.
`localhost:3000/api/users/[usersid]/post/[postid]`.
